max heap binary tree property:

The value at teach node is >= the value of its children.

complete binary tree property:

The tree is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, 
except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, 
if the last level of the tree is not complete, 
the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
(each node has at most 2 children)

New value goes in, or value comes out.

When removing, always remove the maximum value.

When inserting, have to maintain the max heap binary property.


42, 12, 28, 53, 11, 32, 23



Values being inserted randomly.  Violate max heap property initially,
then establish it.

42, 12, 18 works.  52 as a child of 12 does not.  So swap the values.


               42
           12      28
        53

The above becomes

               42
           53      28
        12

This is still not proper.  53 and 42 must be swapped.


               53
           42       28
       12

These processes are called "bubbling up" or "swim"
Adding values, it goes in left to right on the bottom level.

              53
         42       28
     12      11

then...

              53
         42        28
       12  11   32   

then swap 32 and 28

              53
         42        32
      12    11   28

then add last value 23...

             53
        42        32
      12  11    28  23




REMOVING FROM THE TREE............

Now, as we shrink the tree, we have to remove children right to left on the bottom level.

Prefer to preserve complete binary tree property first, instead of max heap property.

We get rid of 53 and replace it with the first value we can... the child on the bottom right.. 23

             23
        42         32
    12     11    28

Now we have to swap 42 and 23.

             42
         23       32
      12    11  28

Putting 23 down here might affect one of the children (12 or 11) if it were 25,
we would then swap 25 and 23.  As it is, its fine.
